### Project Description
Develop a simple web-based platform to manage staff (teachers) and student free time. The platform should allow staff to display their availability (date, time, and contact details) and enable students to input their free time to check which teachers are available during that period. This will improve communication and scheduling efficiency between staff and students.

### The Problem statement
Managing teacher and student availability is a challenge in educational institutions. Teachers have specific free times, and students need to know which teachers are available during their free slots to schedule meetings or seek guidance. A system is needed to streamline this process.

### The Solution
Develop a web-based platform where teachers can input their availability, and students can check which teachers are free during their specified time. This will streamline scheduling and improve communication between staff and students.
